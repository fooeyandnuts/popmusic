== Popmusic

This app is a proof of concept for utilizing an online music service to play songs at specific geographic locations upon reaching them. It came out of an idea that having a playlist for races (marathons, half-marathons, etc...) is great but wouldn't it be awesome to play your power songs at the exact right spot.

It's currently a work in progress but I am accessing Soundcloud user playlists and favorites through their API, creating race routes and saving marker points on the course. Continued progress will include saving specific favorite songs to each marker, associating a playlist to a course. Geolocating at course start and throughout the course, starting the playlist and then switching to the favorite song when the appropriate geofence is reached.

*Technologies used
Rails 4.0.4, PostgreSQL, Bootstrap, Jquery, Soundcloud & Gmaps APIs, Rspec and shoulda matchers.
